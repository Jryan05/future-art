					<h2 class="smallcaps"> My Life in Photos</h2>
					<p> Art is imitating life is a quote that has always stayed with me. We use art as a tool to help us understand or cope with the things going on in our life or the emotions we face. Good art is simply emotion materialized. By showing these photos I hope to show you some pieces of me.</p>
